  <h1>Ethan Yang</h1>
  <p>I'm a junior at MIT studying computer science. I am beginning my MEng, working with
    Prof. <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/lpk/">Leslie Kaelbling</a> and
    Prof. <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/tlp/">Tomás Lozano-Pérez</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm interested in generally capable embodied intelligence. My main goal is to create robots and AI that help humans
    in their day-to-day lives. </p>
  <p>In the fall, I am involved in helping teach <a href="https://manipulation.csail.mit.edu/">Robotic Manipulation</a>.
  </p>
  <p>Previously, I have worked in trading and software engineering at DRW, SIG, and Meta. I also have taught competitive
    programming at various levels.</p>
